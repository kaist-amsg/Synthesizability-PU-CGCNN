# Synthesizability-PU-CGCNN
Synthesizability-PU-CGCNN is a python code for predicting CLscore (crystal-likeness score) which is quantitative synthesizability metric of inorganic crystals. This is a partially supervised machine learning protocol (PU-learning) using CGCNN classifier (by T. Xie et al.) developed by prof. Yousung Jung group at KAIST (contact: ysjn@kaist.ac.kr).
